/*
3.9 Shelf Power and Cooling
---------------------------
Managing power and cooling involves three stages of Shelf status:
Discovery, Normal Operation and Abnormal Operation.

In the Discovery stage, the Shelf Manager collects the following data:
— Shelf Data.

— FRU Consumption. Each FRU must provide information about how much power it (and
any subsidiary components) needs to operate both to initially power on and under steady
state conditions. IPMI commands are defined to provide this data to the Shelf Manager.

— Fan Tray Participation. The Fan Trays in the system can be discovered and queried for
their abilities by the Shelf Manager. Once it understands their abilities, it can control their
speeds during normal and abnormal operation.

Shelf data include the following:

  Shelf Activation and Power Management Record (Table 3-58):

SHELF_ACTIVATION_POWER_RECORD {
	  .
	t_activation_readiness; // number of seconds after system startup
				// that FRUs have to transition to state
				// M3 and maintain their power up sequence
				// position.
	number_fru_power_records = n;
	  .
	FRU_ACTIVATION_POWER_RECORD p[0] {
		hw_addr;
		fru_dev_id;
		max_fru_power_capability; // in Watts
		sh_mgr_controlled_activation;	// If true, Shelf Manager activates this FRU
		delay_before_next_power_on;	// delay before powering up any other
	       					// FRU after powering this FRU
	}
	  .
	  .
	FRU_ACTIVATION_POWER_RECORD p[n];
}

  Shelf Power Distribution Record(s) (Table 3-55, Table 3-56, Table 3-57):
  • Number of power Feeds
  • Maximum External Available Current
  • Maximum Internal Current
  • Minimum Expected Operating Voltage
  • Feed-to-FRU (Identify which FRU is powered by which Feed.)

The Shelf FRU Information may include several Shelf Power Distribution Records
if a single record is not sufficient for describing all Feed-to-FRU mappings.
Any power Feed is always entirely described in a single Shelf Power Distribution
Record. Thus the list of all Feed descriptions is a simple concatenation of the
Power Distribution Map lists of all present records, and the total number of the
power Feeds that supply power to the Shelf is the sum of Number of Power Feeds
fields of all present records.

SHELF_POWER_RECORD feed[0] {
	  .
	number_of_power_feeds = n;
	  .
	POWER_DISTRIBUTION_MAP m[0] {  // one for each feed
		  .
		max_external_current;
		max_internal_current;
		min_expected_operation_voltage;
		number_map_entries = p;
		  .
		FEED_TO_FRU_MAPPING fm[0] {
			hw_id
			fru_dev_id
		}
		  .
		  .
		FEED_TO_FRU_MAPPING fm[p]
          .
	  .
	}
	POWER_DISTRIBUTION_MAP m[n] {

	}
}

The Maximum External Available Current field may be set in the field to indicate
the maximum wattage that has been allocated for the Shelf. This can be used to
throttle a Shelf’s use of power on a particular Feed or to indicate the amount
of power that has been routed to that Feed. Note the Shelf Manager will use the
lesser of the values found in the Maximum External Available Current and Maximum
Internal Current fields to determine the Actual Power Available.

The order of the descriptors is important for determining the power on
sequence. The Shelf Manager checks the existence and operational state of each FRU in the order
they are described in the Shelf FRU Information. As the Shelf Manager steps through the FRU
Activation and Power Descriptors table, each FRU that has reached state M3 is powered on

After
powering up a FRU, the Shelf Manager ensures that another FRU is not assigned a non-zero power
level within Delay Before Next Power On tenths of a second. If a FRU for which activation is
controlled by the Shelf Manager has not reached state M3 by the time the Shelf Manager starts
processing its descriptor in the FRU Activation and Power Descriptors table, the Shelf Manager
waits for the earlier of: 1) the FRU transitioning to M3 and 2) Allowance for FRU Activation
Readiness seconds after initial system startup. After the allowance period, if a FRU is not in M3
when its FRU Activation and Power Descriptor is processed, the Shelf Manager proceeds to the
next descriptor without waiting for that FRU.

The Shelf Manager shall reserve power for the management circuitry at each FRU location by
decreasing the Actual Power Available for each Feed by 10 W times the Feed-to-FRU
Mapping Entries Count defined in Table 3-56, “Power Distribution Map.” This is done so that
the power budget is not exceeded when a new FRU is inserted and the management circuitry
automatically powers up.

If a FRU is found at a Hardware
Address for which a FRU Activation and Power Descriptor is not provided, the Shelf Manager
should not apply power to this FRU. The Shelf Manager may consider such a situation to be a
serious fault and assume that the Shelf FRU Information is corrupted or not up-to-date.

/*
During Normal Operation the Shelf Manager awaits event messages from Boards and/or FRUs to
make any adjustments to Shelf cooling or power distribution from the current operation conditions.
As FRUs are inserted and extracted, the Shelf Manager is alerted and alters power budgets, EKeying,
and possibly cooling based on these conditions. In addition, FRUs may have conditions
change that the Shelf Manager is not directly aware of, so those FRUs can renegotiate power (up or
down) at any point during normal operation. The Shelf Manager may choose to deny the request.

The Abnormal Operation Stage occurs when a Board or FRU generates an Event Message
requesting Shelf services from the Shelf Manager. Typically, the Shelf Manager will adjust system
cooling (e.g., fan rotational velocity) or adjust power to one or more FRUs in an attempt to return
the Shelf to the Normal Operation Stage.

— Cooling Control. Once the Shelf Manager realizes that cooling needs have changed (due
to an event generated by a FRU), it must be able to control the Fan Tray speed to provide
more (or less) cooling (Section 3.9.3.3, “Cooling management,” for details). The “Get Fan
Speed Properties” command (see Table 3-63, “Get Fan Speed Properties command”)
describes how the Shelf Manager queries the Fan Tray device to understand how to
control its behavior. This command returns the Minimum and Maximum Speed Level that
the Fan Tray supports. In addition, the Normal Operating Level describes the default
normal fan speed recommended by the fan manufacturer. Depending on the fan
manufacturer, the Normal Operating Level may be less than the Maximum Speed Level
order to reserve some headroom in case the operating conditions are not optimal.
— Power Control. The Shelf Manager might decide that conditions warrant decreasing
power settings to a FRU or possibly even powering the FRU off entirely. Thus, a FRU can
receive a “Set Power Level” at any time during operation.
*/





/*
At initial startup the Shelf Manager allows Allowance for FRU Activation Readiness seconds for
FRUs that need activation to come to the M3 state. During this time the Shelf Manager processes
hot swap events from those FRUs. When a FRU indicates that it has reached the M2 state, the Shelf
Manager checks its FRU Activation and Power Descriptor in the “Shelf Activation and Power
Management Record” in the Shelf FRU Information. Each FRU that has the Shelf Manager
Controlled Activation field set to Enabled is transitioned to M3 state.
At initial startup the Shelf Manager steps through the FRU Activation and Power Descriptors in
the Shelf FRU Information. The order of the descriptors is important for determining the power on
sequence. The Shelf Manager checks the existence and operational state of each FRU in the order
they are described in the Shelf FRU Information. As the Shelf Manager steps through the FRU
Activation and Power Descriptors table, each FRU that has reached state M3 is powered on via the
multi-step process summarized in Figure 3-14, “Power discovery Board/FRU participation.” After
powering up a FRU, the Shelf Manager ensures that another FRU is not assigned a non-zero power
level within Delay Before Next Power On tenths of a second. If a FRU for which activation is
controlled by the Shelf Manager has not reached state M3 by the time the Shelf Manager starts
processing its descriptor in the FRU Activation and Power Descriptors table, the Shelf Manager
waits for the earlier of: 1) the FRU transitioning to M3 and 2) Allowance for FRU Activation
Readiness seconds after initial system startup. After the allowance period, if a FRU is not in M3
when its FRU Activation and Power Descriptor is processed, the Shelf Manager proceeds to the
next descriptor without waiting for that FRU.
This sequence provides a mechanism for the op

This sequence provides a mechanism for the operator or Shelf vendor to specify how the FRU
should act when power is applied to the Shelf. At a minimum, this mechanism enables specifying
which FRUs must be powered up for the Shelf Manager to have connectivity to the System
Manager. At the extreme, this mechanism allows a fully autonomous Shelf.

The Shelf FRU Information may include several Shelf Activation and Power Management Records
if a single record is not sufficient for describing all FRU locations. If several Shelf Activation and
Power Management Records are present, during the initial Shelf power up sequence, these records
are processed in the order they reside in the Shelf FRU Information.

3.9.1.3 Fan Tray participation
The “Get Fan Speed Properties” command allows the Shelf Manager to query the
Fan Tray to understand how to control its behavior. This command returns the
Minimum and Maximum Speed Level that the Fan Tray supports. In addition, the
Normal Operating Level describes the default normal fan speed recommended by
the fan manufacturer. Depending on the fan manufacturer, the Normal Operating
Level may be less than the Maximum Speed Level in order to reserve some
headroom in case the operating conditions are not optimal.

When a Fan Tray supports Local Control mode, it has the resources to make
intelligent decisions about the speed of the fans. For instance, this might
include a set of temperature sensors that enable it to speed up or slow down
the fans, independent of the Shelf Manager. When Local Control mode is supported,
any speeds that the Shelf Manager sets are considered overrides. The Fan Tray
controller selects the maximum of the override or local control speeds.

In certain emergency situations (such as in a fire condition), either the Shelf
Manager or an intelligent Fan Tray may conclude that an emergency shut down of
the fans is necessary.

• Fan Trays shall reserve enough power envelope such that changing the Fan Level to the
Maximum Speed Level requires no change to the Fan Tray power budget.
• All Fan Trays that support more than one speed shall accept the “Get Fan Speed Properties”,
“Get Fan Level”, and “Set Fan Level” commands.
• In the “Get Fan Speed Properties” command, the Fan Tray IPM Controller shall set the
Minimum Speed Level to be the minimum value that is accepted in the “Set Fan Level”
command.

/* Once the FRU reaches the M3 state, it sends the M2 to M3 event to the Shelf Manager and waits
for the Shelf Manager to begin power and/or cooling negotiation

The first command of the power negotiation sequence, Compute Power Properties, is the
“Compute Power Properties command.” This command is sent by the Shelf Manager to
the IPM Controller to inform the device that it should “lock” in its desired power and cooling
levels. The IPM Controller returns part of this data in the response to this command. In particular,
the data returned is the data that applies to the IPM Controller or FRU itself. This includes
information such as the number of Slots that the FRU spans, if the FRU is a Board and where the
IPM Controller is located.

The Shelf Manager determines the
proper power allocation and sends a “Set Power Level” command to inform the FRU of the power
budget it has been allocated. The M3 state is also the place where the Shelf Manager computes the
E-Keying requirement; however, the FRU can transition to M4 prior to having received its EKeying.
Though E-Keys are computed in M3, the E-keys may be read earlier in the FRU’s life
cycle (i.e., in either M2 or M3). When the Shelf Manager figures out which E-Keying to enable for
the FRU, it sends “Set Port State” command(s) to inform the FRU of the enabled and disabled Ports
Another step the IPM Controller takes when it receives the Compute Power Properties is that it
prepares for the receipt of the “Get Power Level” command.This is especially important when the
IPM Controller is undergoing a power renegotiation. Conceptually, each FRU has an array of up to
20 entries for storing different levels of power draw. This has been further divided into four
categories. The first category is the “Steady state power draw levels”. When an IPM Controller has
powered up and reached a steady state, this array represents the maximum power envelope the
FRU needs to operate at each of the 20 levels. The second is “Desired steady state draw levels”.
This supports a case when a FRU is operating with its “Steady state power draw levels”, but wants
to negotiate for a new power level, it must have a mechanism to communicate the new values to the
Shelf Manager without losing the old values in case the Shelf Manager is unable to allow the new
levels. The third is “Early power draw levels”. This array of values returns the amount of power
draw that the FRU uses up until it is able to reach its steady state power level. For example, if a
Payload is capable of operating at various low power states, but must come up at full power prior to
entering a low power state, then the “Early power draw levels” would be used to indicate that for a
relatively short duration the FRU requires more power than its steady state power draw. The fourth
category covers the “Desired early levels” which describes the desired levels for which the FRU is
negotiating.
To make the negotiation and renegotiation schemes consistent, whenever the FRU receives a
“Compute Power Properties” command, it caches the “desired” levels. Once the IPM Controller
responds to the “Compute Power Properties” command, the Shelf Manager sends the “Get Power
Level” command twice, once for each of the “desired” power levels. The Shelf Manager uses the
information in two responses to see what Power Level the FRU would like to run at and what the
various levels of power draw are.
If the Shelf Manager has the power budget to allow the FRU to change power levels, up or down, it
sends a “Set Power Level” command. Notice that power values returned in bytes 6 and beyond of
the “Get Power Level” command do not need to be linear, but do need to be monotonically
increasing. For example, power level 1 could be 38 W, power level 2 could be 150 W, and power
level 3 could be 200 W. The Shelf Manager simply uses the returned power values to compute the
appropriate Power Level (1 through 3 in the above example) and then sends the “Set Power Level”
command to set the correct level. Power Level 0 is reserved as a power off command for the FRU.
A Shelf Manager that simply wants to control power as off or maximum uses a Power Level of 0 or
Max where Max is the index of the maximum Power Draw provided in the response.
Using the “Set Power Level” command, the Shelf Manager can instruct the FRU about its new
(possibly unchanged) Power Level. In addition, the command allows the Shelf Manager to accept
the desired power levels by “Set Present Levels to Desired Levels”. When the IPM Controller
receives this directive, it adopts the desired levels as its new operating levels. From that point
forward, the FRU must not exceed the power envelope described by the Power Draw[Power
Level] * Power Multiplier.

Periodic verification
----------------------
The Shelf Manager periodically “pings” each Intelligent FRU to verify its presence.
If the FRU does not respond, the Shelf Manager makes a note of that fact by generating
a FRU Hot Swap Event for the system event log (SEL) with a Current State of M7 and
a Previous State of the last known state. Communications are considered
regained if the Shelf Manager eventually receives a response from its “pinging,” or it receives a
new State Change Event (or other message) from the lost FRU. If communication is regained, the
Shelf Manager can determine the current state of the FRU by issuing the “Set Event Receiver”
command. Once the Shelf Manager determines the current state it then asserts a FRU Hot Swap
Event Message with a Current State set to the FRU’s current state, and Previous State of M7.
The spec does not indicate what command to use for pings. We'll use "Get Device ID"
for the time being.

/*
SDR Repository is a single, centralized non-volatile storage area maintained by the Shelf Manager.

As FRUs are inserted and extracted from the Shelf, the Shelf Manager receives events describing
these operations. Since the Shelf Manager knows about these FRUs, it needs to collect this
information together and present it to the System Manager so it does not have to probe the IPMBs
all the time to determine what FRUs are present. The Shelf Manager does this by maintaining an
SDR Repository that, at the very least, has FRU and Management Controller Locator Records for
each FRU in the system. If the Shelf Manager wishes to optimize access to other Sensor Data
Records, it may elect to “import” all Device SDRs from each device into the centralized repository.

FRU Device Locator Record(s)

Management Controller Device Locator Records

At least the partial SDR Repository (with FRU and Management Controller Locator Records)
shall be held persistently such that the Shelf Manager can generate an event after power
restore of any IPM Controller or FRU that did not successfully power back up.

An application that retrieves records from the SDR Repository must first read them out sequentially. This is
accomplished by using the Get SDR command to retrieve the first SDR of the desired type. The response to this
command returns the requested record and the Record ID of the next SDR in sequence in the repository. Note that
Record IDs are not required to be sequential or consecutive. Applications should not assume that SDR Record
IDs will follow any particular numeric ordering.
The application retrieves succeeding records by issuing a Get SDR command using the ‘next’ Record ID that was
returned with the response of the previous Get SDR command. This is continued until the ‘End of Records’ ID is
encountered.

43.8 SDR Type 11h - FRU Device Locator Record
This record is used for locating FRU information that is on the IPMB, on a Private Bus behind or management
controller, or accessed via FRU commands to a management controller. This excludes any FRU Information that
is accessed via FRU commands at LUN 00b of a management controller. The presence or absence of that FRU
Information is indicated using the Management Device Locator record (see Table 37-7, Management Controller
Device Locator - SDR 12h, below).

/*
Renegotiation of Power Level
Whenever a FRU that is in state M3, M4, or M5 wishes to change its power levels, the IPM
Controller sends a “Renegotiate Power” command (see Table 3-66, “Renegotiate Power
command”) to the Shelf Manager for the FRU. This command causes the Shelf Manager to begin a
negotiation with the specified FRU or all FRUs under the IPM Controller. At the end of the
renegotiation the Shelf Manager sends a Set Power Level command to the IPM Controller so it
knows what the conclusion was. In the worst case, the FRU will get a Power Level = FFh and a Set
Present Levels to Desired Levels of “Do not change present levels” indicating that the renegotiation
failed.
*/



/*

when an IPM Controller
detects that a monitored temperature has exceeded one or more upper thresholds. At this point, the
IPM Controller raises a standard IPMI Temperature Event Message and sends it to the Event
Receiver (typically the Shelf Manager). The Shelf Manager uses this event to adjust the fan speeds,
power levels of FRUs, or, in the worst case, begins shutting down FRUs in an attempt to return the
Shelf to the Normal Operation Stage.

In IPMI, thresholds are classified as Non-Critical, Critical, or Non-Recoverable.
AdvancedTCA® uses three levels, but classifies them as minor, major, and critical. This choice of
names avoids the implication that the upper-most level cannot be recovered from and also aligns
with the naming of telco alarm levels

If attempts to increase cooling of the Shelf are
unsuccessful, the Shelf Manager shall attempt to reduce the power consumption of the
distressed FRU (or FRUs, if the condition is not focused on an individual FRU). The “Set
Power Level (Power Level)” command is sent to the FRU or FRUs involved, and those that
are capable of setting lower power levels will reduce their power level in an attempt to
alleviate the over-temperature condition.

When the alert condition reaches critical, the Shelf Manager shall request deactivation of the
FRU via the “Set FRU Activation (Deactivate FRU)” command. The FRU gracefully
completes operations and shuts down. When the condition is not FRU focused, the Shelf
Manager should begin powering down FRUs in the reverse order of the FRU Activation and
Power Descriptors (see Table 3-59, “FRU Activation and Power Descriptor”) until the
condition returns to normal.
• When the Shelf returns to a Normal Operating Condition, the Shelf Manager should return the
cooling to a normal level.
• When the Shelf cooling is increased in response to a distressed FRU that is subsequently
removed from the Shelf, the Shelf Manager should return the cooling for the FRU to a normal
level.

• When the Shelf returns to a Normal Operating Condition from a major temperature event, the
Shelf Manager may restore the power to any FRUs that were stepped down. Care should be
taken that any restoration of power to the FRUs does not cause the over-temperature condition
to occur repeatedly.
• When the Shelf returns to a Normal Operating Condition from a Critical Temperature Event,
the Shelf Manager may power back up any FRUs that were powered off. Care should be taken
that any restoration of power to the FRUs does not cause the over-temperature condition to
occur repeatedly.

*/

/*
Every IPM Controller must contain at least one temperature sensor and an appropriate Sensor Data
Record (SDR) to describe the sensor.
*/



/*SDR Repository A single, centralized non-volatile storage area maintained by the Shelf Manager.*/

/* Shall monitor and control the Shelf IPMB interconnects */


/*
SDRs
IPM Controllers are required to maintain Device Sensor Data Records for the sensors and objects
they manage. Access methods for the Device SDR entries are described in the IPMI specification,
Section 29, “Sensor Device Commands.” After a FRU is inserted, the System Manager, using the
Shelf Manager, may gather the various SDRs from the FRU’s IPM Controller to learn of the
various objects and how to use them. The System Manager would use the “Sensor Device
Commands” to gather this information. Thus, commands, such as “Get Device SDR Info” and “Get
Device SDR”, which are optional in the IPMI specification, are mandatory in AdvancedTCA®
systems.
The implementer may choose to have the Shelf Manager gather the individual Device Sensor Data
Records into a centralized SDR Repository. This SDR Repository may exist in either the Shelf
Manager or System Manager. If the Shelf Manager implements the SDR Repository on-board, it
shall also respond to “SDR Repository” commands.

As FRUs are inserted and extracted from the Shelf, the Shelf Manager receives events describing
these operations. Since the Shelf Manager knows about these FRUs, it needs to collect this
information together and present it to the System Manager so it does not have to probe the IPMBs
all the time to determine what FRUs are present. The Shelf Manager does this by maintaining an
SDR Repository that, at the very least, has FRU and Management Controller Locator Records for
each FRU in the system. If the Shelf Manager wishes to optimize access to other Sensor Data
Records, it may elect to “import” all Device SDRs from each device into the centralized repository.

/* AMC activation - From 3.6.1 Typical Module insertion
This is very similar to ATCA IPMC _SHM interaction except, there are
different power and connection records for the AMC.

The Carrier IPMC reads the Module’s Module Current Requirements record and
AdvancedMC Point-to-Point Connectivity record. The Carrier IPMC checks that
the power requested by a Module can be delivered by the Carrier. This involves
checking that the Maximum Module Current is greater than Current Draw and that
Maximum Internal Current is greater than Current Draw of all Modules that have
been allocated power plus the Current Draw for the Module being negotiated.
See Table 3-10, “Module Current Requirements record” and Table 3-16, “AdvancedMC
Point-to-Point Connectivity record.”

Note: New "Module Hot Swap event" used.
Each MMC contains one Module Hot Swap sensor. This sensor proactively generate events
(Module Handle Closed, Module Handle Opened, Quiesced, Backend Power Shut Down,
and Backend Power Failure) to enable the Carrier IPMC to perform Hot Swap management
for the Modules it represents.

There is a FRU Hot Swap sensor (a distinct object from the Module Hot Swap sensor) for
each FRU that a Carrier IPMC manages (including the Module FRUs). Since the Carrier
IPMC is responsible for maintaining the Hot Swap states for its Module FRUs, the current
state of a Module can be determined by sending a “Get Sensor Reading (FRU Hot Swap
sensor)” command to the Carrier IPMC with the appropriate Hot Swap sensor number. The
AdvancedTCA specification Section 3.2.4.3.2 “Reading the FRU Hot Swap Sensor”
provides more details on this subject.

MicroTCA Carrier Hub
The MicroTCA™ Carrier Hub (MCH) is
defined in the PICMG specification
MicroTCA.0 as a fundamental component
of a MicroTCA enclosure, or “carrier.” The
specification defines common facilities
required of an MCH and shared by the
modules in the payload slots of the carrier.
These common facilities include basic
management of power, cooling, module
control, and clock distribution, in addition to
system status indicators, remote interfaces,
and gigabit Ethernet connectivity to each
payload device. In most cases, the “base”
Ethernet connectivity for the carrier is
provided by an unmanaged Layer-2 switch.
