/*
RMCP ACK messages are not required for IPMI messaging, since IPMI already has
its own messaging retry policies. In addition, some Network Controllers usable
for IPMI messaging do not automatically generate RMCP ACK messages. In these
implementations, the BMC would have to generate the RMCP ACK, resulting in
additional, unnecessary traffic from the BMC. Therefore, RMCP ACK messages
should not be used for IPMI messaging.

- RMCP messages with class=IPMI must have their RMCP sequence number set to
255 (FFh) to indicate that RMCP ACK messages are not to be generated by the
message receiver.
