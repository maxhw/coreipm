This code allows us to talk to port expanders.

We support either an SC18IS600 SPI to i2c/gpio bridge or a coreEXP port expander
based on an LPC210x chip. coreEXP supports the SC18 protocol so the code is
mostly same for both devices. coreEXP has 2 x i2c and 20 GPIOs so it uses a
superset of the SC18 protocol.

/*
Write N bytes to I2C-bus slave device
+---------+----------+------------+--------+-----+--------+
| 0x00    | NUMBER   | SLAVE      | DATA   | ... | DATA   |
| COMMAND | OF BYTES | ADDRESS +W | BYTE 1 |     | BYTE n |
+---------+----------+------------+--------+-----+--------+
The SPI host issues the write command by sending a 0x00 command followed by the total
number of bytes (maximum 96 bytes excluding the address) to send and an I2C-bus slave
device address followed by I2C-bus data bytes, beginning with the first byte (data byte 1)
and ending with the last byte (data byte N). Once the SPI host issues this command, the
expander1 will access the I2C-bus slave device and start sending the I2C-bus data
bytes.
When the I2C-bus write transaction has successfully finished, and interrupt is generated
on the INT pin, and the ‘transaction completed’ status can be read in I2CStat.
Note that the third byte sent by the host is the device I2C-bus slave address. The
expander will ignore the least significant bit so a write will always be performed
even if the least significant bit is a 1.

Once the host issues this command, the expander will start an I2C-bus read
transaction on the I2C-bus to the specified slave address. Once the data is received, the
expander will place this data in the receiver buffer, and will generate an interrupt on
the INT pin. The ‘transaction completed’ status can be read in the I2CStat. Note that the
data is not returned until a read buffer command is performed.

Once the host issues this command, the expander will start a write transaction on
the I2C-bus to the specified slave address. Once the data is written, the expander
will read data from the specified slave, place the data in the Receiver Buffer and generate
an interrupt on the INT pin. The ‘transaction completed’ status can be read in I2CStat.

SPI configuration
When the host issues this command, the SC18IS600/601 will first write N data bytes to
the I2C-bus slave 1 device followed by a write of M data bytes to the I2C-bus slave 2
device.
+---------+---------------+

+---------+---------------+
The SPI configuration command can be used to change the order in which the bits of SPI
data byte are sent on the SPI bus. In the LSB first configuration (SPI configuration data is
0x42), bit 0 is the first bit sent of any SPI byte. In MSB first (SPI configuration data is
0x81), bit 7 is the first bit sent. Valid SPI configuration values are LSB_CONFIG_LSB_FIRST
and LSB_CONFIG_MSB_FIRST

A Write Register function is initiated by sending a 0x20 command followed by an internal

A Read Register function is initiated by sending a 0x21 command followed by an internal
register address to be read and a dummy byte. The data byte of the
read register is returned by the expander on the MISO pin. Only one register can be
accessed in a single transaction. There is no auto-incrementing of the register address.
Note that write and read from internal registers are processed immediately as soon as the
expander determines the intended register.

/*
Programmable IO port configuration register (IOConfig)
------------------------------------------------------
Pins GPIO0 to GPIO3 may be configured by software to one of two types. These are:
push-pull, and input-only. Two configuration bits per pin, located in the
IOConfig register, select the IO type for each pin. For SC18IS601, GPIO3 is
non-existent.

Configurations for the programmable I/O pins. IOx.1 and IOx.0 correspond to GPIOx.

IOx.1	IOx.0 	Pin configuration
---------------------------------
0 	1 	input-only configuration
1 	0 	push-pull output configuration
*/

/*
I/O pins state register (IOState)
---------------------------------
When read, this register returns the actual state of all programmable and
quasi-bidirectional I/O pins. When written, each register bit will be
transferred to the corresponding I/O pin programmed as output.

IOState - I/O pins state register (address 0x01) bit description

Bit 	Symbol 	Description
---------------------------
7:6 	- 	reserved
5 	IO5 	Set the logic level on the output pins.
4	IO4	Write to this register:
3 	GPIO3	logic 0 = set output pin to zero
		logic 1 = set output pin to one
2 	GPIO2
1 	GPIO1
0 	GPIO0
*/

/*
I2C-bus address register (I2CAdr)
---------------------------------
The contents of the register represents the device’s own I2C-bus address. The most
significant bit corresponds to the first bit received from the I2C-bus after a START
condition. The least significant bit is not used, but should be programmed with a ‘0’.
I2CAdr is not needed for device operation, but should be configured so that its address
does not conflict with an I2C-bus device address used by the bus master.
*/

/*
I2C-bus clock rates register (I2CClk) ( 5 is the minimum value )
-------------------------------------
This register determines the I2C-bus clock frequency. The frequency can be
determined using the following formula:

I2C-bus clock frequency (Hz) = 7.3728 x 10^6 / 4 x I2CClk

The I2C-bus clock frequency for the SC18IS601 can be determined using the following
formula:

I2C-bus clock frequency (Hz) = CLKIN / 4 x I2CClk
*/

/*
I2C-bus time-out register (I2CTO)
---------------------------------
The time-out register is used to determine the maximum time that the I2C-bus master is
allowed to complete a transfer before setting an I2C-bus time-out interrupt.

Bit	Symbol		Description
7:1 	TO[7:1] 	Time-out value
0 	TE 		Enable/disable time-out function
			logic 0 = disable
			logic 1 = enable

The least significant bit of I2CTO (TE bit) is used as a time-out enable/disable. A logic 1
will enable the time-out function.

On the SC18IS600 the time-out oscillator operates at 57.6 kHz. For the SC18IS601 the
time-out oscillator frequency can be determined using the following formula:

frequency = CLKIN / 128

This oscillator is fed into a 16-bit down counter. The down counter’s lower nine bits are
loaded with ‘1’, while the upper seven bits are loaded with the contents of I2CTO.
